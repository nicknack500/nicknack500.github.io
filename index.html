        John Smith is a Student at the University of South Carolina. He needs to be able to efficiently find parking
        before his classes since he does not own a University parking pass, and instead relies upon street parking.
        "I just can't keep wasting 10 plus minutes of my day looking for parking before each class" - John Smith.

        <p>
        The displayed storyboard shows John Smith utilizing our Parking Assistant App in order to
        quickly find parking for his classes. The first panel shows him using the app as soon as he gets to his car, and checking available parking.
        He find parking near his chosen academic building, then parks his car. He makes it to class early instead of barely on time or even late
        as a result of being able to know exactly where available parking is located.

       The displayed sketch serves as a sort of prototype for I want the application to look once implemented, including arrows/dotted lines
       demonstrating where each button would lead once pressed. The app utilizes a map integration with parking lots highlighted, and the user can see
       and "check in" to different parking lots pending on availability.

        This is the paper prototype we created that best represents how we want to design and style our application. The video provided demonstrates
        all functionality that the application would contain, as well as a rough idea of the UI design.
