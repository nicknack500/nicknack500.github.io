        John Smith is a Student at the University of South Carolina. He needs to be able to efficiently find parking
        before his classes since he does not own a University parking pass, and instead relies upon street parking.
        "I just can't keep wasting 10 plus minutes of my day looking for parking before each class" - John Smith.
